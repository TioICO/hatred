## "hatred": discord account nuke/lock/dox

view the original project [here](https://github.com/azaelgg/Jajaja-Account-Nuker) | azaelgg's 'jajaja' account nuker

### features:
* Nuke/lock victim's account via token
* Log-in victim's account via token
* "Dox" victim's account via token, comes with payment information.

cleanly-written, simple & efficient account-nuker with the capability of phone-locking non-verified accounts.

the code's much more optimized, faster & provides a pretty self-explanatory GUI.

currently, the **phone-lock** method is an older one i discovered, and i've now found an account-disable method: hence why i've made this tool public.
